Enhancement: Lazy loading avatar

The formerly used `vue-avatar` library used a wrapping div (which led to invalid HTML when used inside e.g. a button tag) 
and rendered the avatar image as an background image (which can not easily be lazy-loaded and blocked the page rendering).

By switching to an enhanced fork of the official library, we could solve both of those issues.
