Bugfix: Resource component type can't be button

The `<oc-resource>` component used in the files table rendered links for folders and 
buttons for files until now. Since clicking on a file navigates to a new route (e.g. mediaviewer) 
or downloads the file (which should be a `<a>` tag), files also need to be rendered as links.
