Bugfix: Reverted oc-text-input and added oc-form-input instead

As the `oc-text-input` component should stay as simple as possible, being only an input element,
we have extracted the validation message features into a new pattern component, wrapping
`oc-text-input` and a message. All properties and listeners applied to `oc-form-input` will be
forwarded into the internally used `oc-text-input` component.
