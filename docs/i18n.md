## Right to left (RTL)

> RTL (Right To Left) is a locale property indicating that text is written from right to left. For example, the `he` locale (for Hebrew) specifies right-to-left. Arabic (`ar`) is another common language written RTL.

### Applying right to left

- You can enable right to left on a document level with the following HTML: `<html dir="rtl">...</html>`
- You can enable right to left on an element level with the following CSS: `#something { direction: rtl; }`
- If you want to combine left to right (ltr) and right to left (rtl) text you should also use `unicode-bidi: embed;` in your CSS ([explainer on unicode-bibi](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unicode-bidi))
- With the application of rtl on a document level certain parts of your styling/interface change layout:

### CSS Layout reacting to `html[dir="rtl"]`

- Elements positioned via CSS Flexbox
- Elements positioned via CSS Grid
- Elements positioned via CSS Position relative

### CSS Layout NOT reacting `html[dir="rtl"]`

- Elements positioned via CSS Floats
- Elements positioned via CSS Absolute Positioning
- Text align via css (left stays left, right stays right)

### RTL and Uikit

- Uikit's JavaScript supports right to left by default
- For Uikit's CSS support there are two steps needed:
  - Enabling it on a document level with `<html dir="rtl">...</html>`
  - Usage of `uikit.rtl.min.css`
- CSS classes that are explicitly named `*-left` or `*-right` stay the same in the RTL version.
